<li>
<p>For the given perceptron network, observe that the intial assignment of weights is completely random.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe the number of iterations required for the weights to converge, i.e. to achieve classification for the given case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat the experiment for different number of samples per class and observe if there exists a relation between the number of samples per class and iteration steps required to converge .</p>
