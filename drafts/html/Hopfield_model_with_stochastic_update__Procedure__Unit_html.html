<li>
<p>Ensure that the temperature pointer is set to zero intially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move the mouse cursor over the states in the state transition diagram to find the possible transition from each state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the temperature by clicking at some place on temperature bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move the mouse cursor again over the states in the state transition diagram, and note the change in the nature of the transition to stochastic update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep increasing and decreasing the temperature, and check the change in probability of transition to states with higher energy in the table provided in the experiment panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the "Click Here to View the Annealing Schedule" button to go to next panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the temprature of the bar is at 1.0, observe the values obtained for one run of the schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on successive lower values of temprature on the bar to lower the temprature from 1.0 to 0.0 .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe the change in the state probabilities in the table provided.</p>
