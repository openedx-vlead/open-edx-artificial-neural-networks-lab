<li>
<p>Number of cities = 100 and number of neurons in the output layer = 2000</p>

<li>
<p>Number of cities = 100 and number of neurons in the output layer = 50</p>

<p>In each case, compute the number of cities that have not been visited even once.</p>

<p>Plot the percentage of cities visited, as a function of the number of iterations in either cases.</p>
