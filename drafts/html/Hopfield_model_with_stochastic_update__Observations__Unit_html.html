<li>
<p>Take any state in the state transition diagram and observe the change in the probabilities of transition with change in temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe the trend of probability with temperature while transiting to a state with higher energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try annealing schedule for a couple of times with different set of temparatures, see whether the states settle to similar probabilities or different.</p>
