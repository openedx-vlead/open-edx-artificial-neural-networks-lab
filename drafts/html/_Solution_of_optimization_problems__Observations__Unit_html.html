<p>Observe the connected graph has been partitioned into required spaces with the minimum number of connections in between.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe the effect of changing the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\delta T\) for the annealing schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vary the number of nodes and edges and observe if there exists any relation between \(\delta T\) and number of nodes/edges.</p>
