<h3>Application of SOM to travelling salesman problem</h3>
<p>Let us consider a SOM&nbsp; network with 1000 neurons in the output layer, for the travelling salesman problem of 100 cities. The 2-dimensional input represents the coordinate values of a city. The units in the output layer are arranged (indexed) along a closed curve or ring. The weights vectors corresponding to adjacent units are joined in the weight space. In the following demonstration, the plots show the coordinates of the cities (marked by symbol 'x')&nbsp; and the weight vectors (marked by symbol 'o'). The initialization of weight vectors along the rim of a ring is known as elastic ring approach in feature mapping. Plots show the closed path after 500, 1000 and 10000 iterations, respectively. Some of the cities may not be visited, which indicates the suboptimal nature of the algorithm.</p>

<h3>Effect of varying the number of units in output layer of SOM</h3>
<p><br />For the travelling salesman problem of 50 cities, we consider SOM networks with different number of units/nodes in the output layer. In the following demonstration, the plots show the coordinates of the cities (marked in black)&nbsp; and the weight vectors (marked in red).&nbsp; Plots show the closed path after 50, 100, 200 and 300 units in the output layer of SOM. Some of the cities may not be visited, which indicates the suboptimal nature of the algorithm.</p>
