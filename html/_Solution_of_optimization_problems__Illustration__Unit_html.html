<p>The Hopfield model for the solution of graph bipartition problem is discussed here. While performing this experiment it is necessary to understand the issues associated with annealing of Hopfield model.</p>

<p>Figure 1 illustrates a graph with 4 nodes before the process of annealing. Figure 2 shows the input graph and the bi partitioned graph.</p>

<p>We see that even if there exists a solution through annealing, it need not lead to the optimum solution of the bipartition. The graph still is not divided in parts containing equal number of nodes as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p>We see that in the case of more number of nodes, annealing leads to the optimum solution of the bipartition. The graph still is now divided in parts containing equal number of nodes as illustrated in Fig. 4.</p>
