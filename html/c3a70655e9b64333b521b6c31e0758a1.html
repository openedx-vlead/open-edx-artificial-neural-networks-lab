<li>
<p>Variation of error as a function of time-step/epoch</p>
<p>(a) Observe the variation in case of pattern mode and batch mode. In the former case, the variation of error would be less smoother than in the latter case.</p>
<p>(b) In each case, observe the number of epochs required for the error to converge to a given value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convergence of weight values</p>
<p>(a) Observe the plot of individual weight values as functions of time-step/epoch. Each weight value may converge over time, or oscillate within limits, indicating that it is near a minimum in the error surface.</p>
<p>(b) Observe the number of epochs required for convergence in the case of pattern mode and batch mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-validation</p>
<p>(a) For the subset of input patterns, observe the values of the corresponding outputs, and compare the obtained outputs with desired outputs. What is the error between the two ?</p>
<p>(b) Is the cross-validation error lesser for batch mode or for the pattern mode ?</p>
