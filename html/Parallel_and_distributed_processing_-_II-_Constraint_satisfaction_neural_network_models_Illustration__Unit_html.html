<h3>Illustration of Constraint Satisfaction Model</h3>
<p>In this experiment, we use the PDP model called the Constraint Satisfaction Model, to illustrate how we as humans, attempt building of concepts as well as to arrive at conclusions given weak evidences. We start with a set of 40 descriptors used to characterize different room types. These descriptors can also be referred as <i>hypotheses</i> . Also present with the model is the relationship between these descriptors, acting as <i>constraints</i>, which can either be weak or strong. So eventually given a set of such hypotheses and weak or strong constraints between these, we arrive at some knowledge towards a particular room type in this example. The experiment first shows all the 40 descriptors involved in capturing knowledge for a given room type.</p>

<p>The constraint satisfaction model which is illustrated in this experiment is already trained. We can view the model using <i>Hinton Diagram</i> by clicking on the "CLICK" button on top. A new panel showing the Hinton Diagram for all the descriptors appears where 40 hypotheses have their corresponding squares with constraints between them and other hypotheses being displayed within the larger square. Moving the mouse over the squares presents their zoomed picture at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>In the above diagram we notice that each large square represents a unit. There are 40 units corresponding to 40 descriptors. Within the square of each unit a replica of all the 40 units are displayed as smaller squares or dots, each dot representing the unit in its relative position in the diagram. Around each dot, weak constraints are depicted by smaller squares in lighter gray shade. Similarly strong constraints is represented by darker gray or black color with a square of larger size. There are many units which have no connections at all.</p>
<p>The constraint satisfaction model is used to illustrate the ability of human beings to build concepts or arrive at conclusion based on partial and sometime erroneous knowledge. The key idea of the model is that a large number of weak constraints when put together, evolve into a definitive conclusion. To test the model, some units can be clamped or say provided a constant external bias. As shown in the figure below, we can click on the units and have these clamped.</p>

<p>After clamping the model is allowed to relax by computing the next state for each unit selected at random. The state computation is done by computing sum of the weighted inputs and thresholding the weighted sum using hard-limiting output function. After we click the test network button, we find that after running through some iterations the network settles to a state where no further change in the state of descriptors is visible. And then the state description gives the description of the concept of the room satisfying the external evidence or <i>clamping</i></p>
