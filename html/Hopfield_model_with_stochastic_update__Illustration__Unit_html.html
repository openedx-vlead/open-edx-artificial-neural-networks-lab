<h3>Illustration of stochastic update of Hopfield model and probabilistic transitions</h3>
<p>For the illustration, let us consider a three unit Hopfield model. At temperature T=0, the state update reduces to deterministic case. But as with increase in the temperature parameter value, the activation dynamics become stochastic in nature. The probability of firing keeps changing with change in the temperature according to the given probability function. For nonzero values of the temperature, there is a tendency to jump to states having higher energy values. As T approaches infinity, the state update no longer depends on the activation values, and hence \( \Delta V \le 0\) is no longer true, where V is the energy.<br /><br /> The following diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the behaviour of the state 010 at T=0 temperature.</p>

<br />
<p>If the temperature is increased to T = 0.3, the state transition diagram is as shown in the Figure 2. It can be seen that there is nonzero probability of transition from a given state to a state having higher energy.</p>

<p>The probability of transition to higher energy state increases as the value of the temperature parameter is increased further, as shown in Figure 3 for T = 1.0 .</p>

<h3>Simulated Annealing</h3>
<p>For the 3-unit network, the stationary probability distribution of states for a given temperature is obtained using the equation</p>
<p>\( p_{i}(t+1) = \sum\limits_{j}p_{j}(t)p(i/j), ~ for ~ i = 0,1,2, ..., 7 \)</p>
<p>where \( p_{i}(t) \) is the probability of the state \(i\) at time t and \( p(i/j) \) is the transition probability from state \(j\) to state \(i\) for a given temperature. Starting with equal probabilities for all the states \( p_{i}(0) = \frac{1}{8}, ~ i = 0,1, ..., 7,~ \) the above equation converges to stationary probability distribution after a few iterations. At that stage, the value of T is decreased according to some annealing schedule, until the value of T is close to zero. The resulting state transition probabilities for different iterations and at different temperatures of the annealing schedule can be seen in the table in second part of experiment. Note that at T = 0, there are only a few states which have nonzero probabilities and all other states have zero probability. The distribution of the nonzero probabilities are inversely related to the energy of those states according to Boltzmann-Gibb's law. The table illustrates the principle of simulated annealing for overwriting the effects of false minima. It is important to note that while performing the annealing of the network, we always slowly lower the temperature.</p>
