<p>During the course of performance of the experiments, we understand the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ol><ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of iterations help in capturing the pattern in an efficient way. But the network weights generally saturate after some iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no significant change in the weight values of the nodes of CLNN after some iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There cannot be an accurate capture of pattern, but a better approximation can be reached with more nodes in the network.</p>
